% Template for USENIX papers.
%
% History:
%
% - TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%   USENIX '05. originally a template for producing IEEE-format
%   articles using LaTeX. written by Matthew Ward, CS Department,
%   Worcester Polytechnic Institute. adapted by David Beazley for his
%   excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings, Tcl 96. turned into a
%   smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to both the
%   above pioneers. Use at your own risk. Complaints to /dev/null.
%   Make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point.
%
% - Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to
%   separate the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that
%   people can more easily include the .sty file into an existing
%   document. Also changed to more closely follow the style guidelines
%   as represented by the Word sample file.
%
% - Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you
%   want foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the
%   usepackage command, below.
% - This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09
%   stuff.
%
% - Updated July 2018: Text block size changed from 6.5" to 7"
%
% - Updated Dec 2018 for ATC'19:
%
%   * Revised text to pass HotCRP's auto-formatting check, with
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.body_font_size=10pt, and
%     hotcrp.settings.submission_form.line_height=12pt
%
%   * Switched from \endnote-s to \footnote-s to match Usenix's policy.
%
%   * \section* => \begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract}
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of bibtex entires, to allow
%     this file to be compiled. (And changing refs style to 'plain'.)
%
%   * Make template self-contained in terms of figures, to
%     allow this file to be compiled. 
%
%   * Added packages for hyperref, embedding fonts, and improving
%     appearance.
%   
%   * Removed outdated text.

\section*{Acknowledgments}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The USENIX latex style is old and very tired, which is why
there's no \textbackslash{}acks command for you to use when
acknowledging. Sorry.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section*{Availability}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

USENIX program committees give extra points to submissions that are
backed by artifacts that are publicly available. If you made your code
or data available, it's worth mentioning this fact in a dedicated
section.
